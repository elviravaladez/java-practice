FLOAT AND DOUBLE
----------------

Floating point numbers
     - have fractional parts that we express with a decimal point
        Ex: 3.14159

     - known as real numbers
     - used when we need more precision in calculations
     - The double data type is accepted by default for floating point numbers


FLOAT
    - single precision number
    - has a range from 1.4E-45 to 3.4028235E+38
    - end float with "f" OR cast, recommended to use "f"
    - NOT RECOMMENDED to use float

    Ex:
        float myFloatValue = 5.25f; (preferred method)
        float myFloatValue = (float)5.25;


DOUBLE
    - double precision number
    - more precise
    - has a range from 4.9E-324 to 1.7976931348623157E+308
    - end double with "d"
    - BEST to use DOUBLE


Precision refers to the format and amount of space accupied by the type.
    - Single precision occupies 32 bits
        - Width of 32

    - Double precision occupies 64 bits
        - Width of 64
