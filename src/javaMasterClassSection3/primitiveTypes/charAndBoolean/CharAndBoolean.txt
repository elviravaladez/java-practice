char
    - occupies 2 bytes of memory
    - occupies 16 bits
    - has a width of 16
    - saves only one character

    - the reason it's NOT a single byte is b/c it allows you to store UNICODE CHARACTERS

    - Ex: use when storing the last key press or single digit, storing data in arrays

Unicode
    International encoding standard for use w/diff. languages and scripts by which each
    letter, digit, or symbol is assigned a unique numeric value that applies across
    diff. platforms and programs.

    Unicode allows us to represent languages that need more characters.

    The way it works is by using a combo. of the TWO BYTES that a CHAR takes up
    in memory it can represent and one of 65535 diff. types of characters.
